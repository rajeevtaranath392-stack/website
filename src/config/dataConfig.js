      "One of India’s acclaimed classical instrumentalists, Rajeev Taranath’s distinctive musicianship demonstrated striking imaginative power, technical excellence, and emotional range.",
    desc2:
      "A distinguished sarod exponent of the Senia Maihar Gharana, Rajeev Taranath was honored nationally by the Government of India with the 2019 Padma Shri and the 1999-2000 Sangeet Natak Akademi award and within his home state of Karnataka (including the 1998 Chowdiah Memorial and the 2018 Sangeet Vidhwan, 2019 Nadoja awards) where he was recognized as a pioneering influence in South India.",
    desc3: `A venerable disciple of the great sarod maestro Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, he received crucial guidance from two other legendary musicians of this musical lineage, Pt. Ravi Shankar and Vidushi Annapurna Devi. The revered and beloved musician passed away on June 11, 2024 in Mysore, India. We are truly heartbroken and yet also full of gratitude for the experience of knowing and learning from this extraordinary musician, and generous, noble human being.`

    { quote: "The great filmmaker Mani Kaul noted so aptly about the oral and aural tradition – the raga emerges not in this note or that note but between the notes.  It is in the approach, in its context within the raga." },
    { quote: "The note itself is the truth. When it is right, good, clean, full, it is true.  Go at it!" },
    { quote: "I would like to describe the essence of our traditional music-education as being emphatically a matter of imparting precise musical intonations." },
    { quote: "Vocal music is at the center of classical Indian music.  Vocalism is the thing that makes a raga more than a scale. It helps sense and convey the “juice” of a given raga." },
    { quote: "The instrument gets into the business of mining the voice and, in so doing, find their own genius." },
    { quote: "With age, experience or perhaps with choice of ragas, one finds corners and spaces that seemed hidden in the raga before.There is a kind of patience that you learn to take with you to the raga. If you’re patient, the raga will speak to you eventually." },
    { quote: "Learning and practicing then, is like setting hurdles up for oneself, set up one hurdle, conquer that and then set up a tougher hurdle for the next and then conquer that one as well, even as an athlete might train, and continue this as an endless process.  Intensity in the artist is a result of this process – not so much a starting place." },
    { quote: "Spreading the ideas or vistaars is like seeing how one can spread a small pat of butter on a piece of bread." },
    { quote: "An understanding of the vastness of a raga, of possibilities, begins to happen progressively more and more. Similar to climbing a mountain, the higher one goes, step by step, the more one sees." },
    { quote: "A musician must have intimate knowledge of vocal music.  The relish of it should be felt.  In the absence of this relish, our instrumental music becomes very mechanical." },
    { quote: "A raga should go on being with you in some sense throughout your day." },
    { quote: "A performing art is the ultimate test of honesty." },
    { quote: "It is axiomatic that one can only think in language with words one knows.  It is not as if I go beyond my technique, my body – as everything that I play, at any given time or moment is heavily dependent on what I can play." },
    { quote: "How can one still see new structures within a music and a raag?  If given more time, I will go more and more toward radiant simplicities. Those simplicities are the product of a lifetime." },
    { quote: "A certain amount of evaluation is probably present when the artist is consciously trying to develop and hone both his skills and his musical ideas. I don’t know perfectionism but I do strive towards achieving what I perceive. This is a continuous process." },
    { quote: "Relish is not something end-oriented. It is an experience so fully set in the moment – like food for example. When deeply enjoyed, you don’t wait until you are finished, it is in every bite, each spoonful. As a teacher, one cannot truly teach the idea and importance of relish.  You can take someone with you along the way, and then see if the value and relish of the music takes effect on that person. One cannot assert it. For this, humility is compulsory." },
    { quote: "“You are the music while the music lasts” (T.S. Eliot).   At the beginning of a performance I am a bit nervous, getting to terms with what is there.  Eventually as the performance continues, maybe not that I am watching myself – but I have lost my sense of me.  I want to be aware that I have everything available to be what I would like to be." },
    { quote: "The most vivid moment in music I remember is the first experience of hearing Ali Akbar Khan, it was electrifying, life changing for me." },
    { quote: "The artist or maestro, as T.S. Eliot says, “lives at a conscious point where past and future are gathered”. He has all the richness of the past, waiting to pass it on to the future, for his students to gather it all." },
    { quote: "To make better music – there is a desire, which is a life-long process- to create a match - to bring the thought and performance nearer and nearer.   Actually it is the desire to translate what is happening in your mind into your fingers – even without that gap. The finger itself becomes imagination." },
    { quote: "It is important to find more and more substantiality in a contentment that you get in music not only in performing in a hall but in simply playing music, as finally, performing is only a subsidiary of playing." },
    { quote: "If you want to hear someone you love, you will hear them through all the traffic - on the other side of the street, downtown, - you will still hear them.”  said after a student remarked on a phrase “this is so subtle. Is it possible for me to get this?" },
    { quote: "Another factor that one must be aware of is—you grow as a musician because of what the instrument can give you." },
    { quote: "Learning within an oral & aural tradition requires an alertness and responsibility" },
    { quote: "One should know and learn what to listen for. One needs to imbibe this over time, and come to a sense of what is excellence." },
    { quote: "When music education shifted to modern colleges, we forgot the fact that our aural, oral tradition of music was a matter of intonation. We opted simply and wrongly for numbers—of ragas, compositions and talas.  In trying to shift music education we destroyed the basis on which it had rested for centuries." },
    { quote: "Playing the raga is rather like spreading butter on bread. You’ve got to see how well you can spread it, and how widely you can spread it. You must push at the frontiers of the raga, and yet see that it doesn’t break. If the raga breaks, you are in a kind of melodic anonymity, which ultimately breaks you as a classical musician." },
    { quote: "The study of literature doesn’t teach me to create a poem, it asks me to look at a poem. But a music class teaches me to create music. That’s the fundamental difference between these disciplines." },

That was in 1965, when an educational institution offered him a job. By then, a decade had passed since Rajeev first met Hindustani virtuoso Ali Akbar Khan, whom he made his guru. Lessons from the maestro at Calcutta had made the youngster a promising sarod player. The resonant slides he generated on the fretless instrument gave audiences the impression that Rajeev could visualise the ragas he rendered unhurriedly. This feature appeared like an extension of his PhD thesis on the image in Eliot’s modernism.",
